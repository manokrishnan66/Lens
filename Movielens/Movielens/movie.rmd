# 1. Introduction

The main objective here is producing product recommendations through a analytical system by applying statistical techniques. We are taking movielens database to predict ratings of the movies.

The 10M version of the dataset available in the grouplens website. Based on the different statical models, we will build a rating predictor system. 

### Dataset
- [MovieLens 10M] https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/
- [MovieLens 10M- zip file] http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip

### Data Loading

```{r data_load, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
if(!require(tidyverse)) install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
if(!require(caret)) install.packages("caret", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
if(!require(data.table)) install.packages("data.table", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

library(readr)
movies <- read_delim("ml-10M100K/movies.dat", 
                     "::", escape_double = FALSE, col_names = FALSE, 
                     trim_ws = TRUE)
View(movies)
ratings <- read_delim("ml-10M100K/ratings.dat", 
                     "::", escape_double = FALSE, col_names = FALSE, 
                     trim_ws = TRUE)


movies <- movies %>% select(-X2,-X4)
colnames(movies) <- c("movieId", "title", "genres")

ratings <- ratings %>% select(-X2,-X4,-X6)
colnames(ratings) <- c("userId", "movieId", "rating", "timestamp")

movies <- as.data.frame(movies) %>% mutate(movieId = as.numeric(movieId)[movieId],
                                           title = as.character(title),
                                           genres = as.character(genres))

ratings <- as.data.frame(ratings) %>% mutate(userId = as.numeric(userId),
                                              movieId = as.numeric(movieId),
                                              rating = as.numeric(rating),
                                             timestamp = as.numeric(timestamp))


movielens <- left_join(ratings, movies, by = "movieId")


```

### Libraries

The following libraries were used in this report:
```{r libs, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Aim & Objectives

The main objective in this report is to train a machine learning algorithm using the inputs of a provided subset (edx dataset) to predict movie ratings in a provided validation set.

Additionally, gglpot2 is used in the data exploration section to reveal some interesting trends in the dataset and the factors that affects the users' ratings.  The  assessments of the 4 models that will be developed is based on their resulting RMSE. Lastly, the optimal model is used to predict the movie ratings.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
